What currently runs:
     Our current implementation successfully implements the base system status web service, 
multiple client support, protocol independence, and file serving requests. The test script 
gives full points for minimum requirements, IPv6 functionality, and extra tests. The test 
script sometimes hangs during the malicious tests, but about half the time it will simply 
crash the server, giving 8 points for robustness.
 
Design Description:
       Our server opens sockets and listens to requests from connectors. When a request 
gets sent, our server creates a thread to handle the request. The message is parsed and 
handled according to what is asked, whether it be for loadavg or others, and if it is in
 HTTP 1.0 or 1.1 protocol. The results from the request are sent over the file descriptor back to the client.
